## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Use the PR template to provide important information about your work.
3. Your pull request will be reviewed in two separate stages. The first stage requires that an authorized contributor 
signs off on the changes. The second stage required the head reviewer to take a look and make the appropriate changes.
